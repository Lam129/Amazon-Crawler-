The interchangeable lenses (polarized/anti-glare) are a plus (night riding).I have yet to experiment with the audio (earphones) or the \"bluetooth\" for that matter as such I have no comments to offer.I had a problem setting the date correctly (I gave up). The instructions are difficult to understand but if you persevere with the \"scientific method\" (experimentation+notes) you will eventually get the gist of the operational basics (most of which have already been offered in other reviews here).I have included some footage obtained with this tiny camera. Not bad at all, right?\n\nRead more"},

 "title": "Good product but struggled to set the time",
 "rating": 4.0,
 "body": "This product is very good value for money, but badly translated instructions made it difficult to figure some things out.Setting the time was the hardest part for me, the instructions are badly translated from Chinese into English and it didn't make it obvious what you were meant to do.What you are meant to do is plug the glasses into a computer and double click the time.bat file.  This should create a file named Time.txt that contains the date and time.However, the bat file didn't work correctly for me as it put some full stops (if you're American read period) instead of numbers for certain parts of the date and time, and therefore it reverted to the Chinese time zone.Due to being a programmer and having experience with .bat files, I managed to rewrite it so that it worked and corrected the time.If you copy the following into the time.bat file and run it, it should work. Please note, I'm based in the UK so it may need a different .bat file for where you live.@echo offmode con cols=30 lines=2:aclsset a=%time%set hh=%a:~0,2%set mm=%a:~3,2%set ss=%a:~6,2%set cf=%a:~7,1%set ff=%a:~6,1%set b=%date%set yy=%b:~6,4%set zz=%b:~3,2%set dd=%b:~0,2%set xx=%b:~11,3%color %ff%%cf%if \"%mm%\"==\"00\" echo error &clsif \"%hh%\"==\" 0\"  set hh=00if \"%hh%\"==\" 1\"  set hh=01if \"%hh%\"==\" 2\"  set hh=02if \"%hh%\"==\" 3\"  set hh=03if \"%hh%\"==\" 4\"  set hh=04if \"%hh%\"==\" 5\"  set hh=05if \"%hh%\"==\" 6\"  set hh=06if \"%hh%\"==\" 7\"  set hh=07if \"%hh%\"==\" 8\"  set hh=08if \"%hh%\"==\" 9\"  set hh=09echo %yy%.%zz%.%dd% %hh%:%mm%:%ss%>>time.txtexit\n\nRead more"},

 "rating": 5.0,
 "body": "These are pretty good.  Not great, as the price indicates they are a budget pair.  They do the job.  I use these for cycling to and from work.  Charged fully they will record both of my journies.The quality of the video is good, not great.  It's good enough for what I needed which was just to monitor my ride.  In case people hit me, or there was an issue where I might later be called up for something. The file sizes are not big either.You get two sets of lens', one black and the other are yellow.  I used the yellow ones during the winter months where I was cycling in the dark.  The black ones were perfect for daytime rides when the sun was out.I did try the headphones out with music playing, but only when I was out for a walk.  Can't be doing that kind of stuff when you are cycling. The sound quality is not great. It's average. The headphones play a big part in this, I think with better earphones, you'd get a much better experience.Now there does not seem to be any IP rating, but I did use mine during a flash storm.  Which was fun.  They survived, but I think this is more to do with the fact my helmet may have been protecting them. I would recommend them to people looking for cheap polarised sunglasses with a built-in camera.These do the job at an affordable price.\n\nRead more"},

 "rating": 2.0,
 "body": "Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n\n\n  \u00a0Ugh, I really wanted to like these, however there is no way to remove the date at all, so your stuck with a date in the middle of your image at all times.Can't remove it. I've tried playing with text file it saves on and it won't adjust also. I've included footage showing it for people. You might want this. I do not.Same with video and constant date imprinted, and it sits about 2/5 up screen on left hand side, like an old school camcorder, footage is OK, no where near 1080i as described maybe closer to 720i.Also 2020 and it records as avi file not mp4 which I havnt used in about a decade, meaning you loose about 1gb of space for every 7 minutes.So your going to have to convert it to mp4 via an app or software, as not everything edits an avi now days.Honestly annoyed as it wasn't mentioned anywhere about it, and actually daytime and night time filming is decent enough otherwise.I'd given it 3.5 outta 5 otherwise, but the awkward date brings it down to 2 outta 5.Sits well on face but are too narrow for effective sunglasses usage. Don't pay \u00a330, if you want these get them cheaper elsewhere, I needed them next day urgent.\n\nRead more"},
